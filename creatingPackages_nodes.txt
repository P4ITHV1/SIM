1. Creating a catkin workspace

#we first create a directory

mkdir catkin_ws
Cd catkin_ws/
mkdir src
catkin_make
ls

#we will have two folders named devel and build
#inside src we will have a CMakeList created by catkin

#we now go into the bashrc file, from devel
nano ~/.bashrc
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
#save and exit

#we now create a ros package
cd catkin_ws/src/
catkin_create_pkg my_robot_tutorials roscpp rospy std_msgs
cd my_robot_tutorials/
ls
#inside src we will have CMakeLists.txt and Package.xml

#now navigate to your catkin_ws and into your package that is my_robot_tutorials
mkdir scripts

#go into this folder
touch my_first_node.py
chmod +x my_first_node.py
nano my_first_node.py

#now type this code into the python for creating a node
#1/usr/bin/env python3
Import rospy
If __name__=='__main__':
	rospy.init_node('my_first_python_node')
	rospy.loginfo("this node has been started")
	rate = rospy.Rate(10)
	while not rospy.is_shutdown():
		rospy.loginfo("hello")
		rate.sleep()

#now open a new terminal and run roscore
#now run the python file : python3 my_first_node.py

We can also run rqt_graph for getting the graph
